    <h2>Donkey Kong Arcade Remake In UE5</h2>
    <img src="Images/donkeykongpic.png" alt="Donkey Kong Image">
    <p>This project was my first introduction to 2D game development in Unreal Engine 5. I strived to recreate the iconic arcade title Donkey Kong. Overall, I am happy with the outcome and learned a ton about 2D development like creating tile sets, making tile maps, importing character sprites, creating flipbook animations, and designing player movement systems. On top of that, I learned how to create enemies and implement AI movement and behaviors. This project was a short one and only took around two weeks to recreate the first level. That being said, it is not a finished level, and I need more time to make it 100% accurate to the original.</p>

    <h2>2D Platformer Game</h2>
    <img src="Images/2dgameportfolio.jpg" alt="2D Platformer">
    <p>This was my first game coded in C++. I learned a lot from this project and honestly had a great time working on it. In total, I would say this project took me about two weeks, and I can confidently say that I have an understanding of basic programming using C++. The premise of the game is to see how fast the player can reach 100 points, which results in a "You Win" screen. Each ghost is worth 10 points, so the player only has to defeat 10 ghosts to win. If the player gets hit three times, they lose and see a "Game Over" screen.</p>

    <p>There were many systems and gameplay features I designed and implemented, such as enemy movement and detection, player mechanics (movement, attack, animations, attack projectiles), a timer, and additional features like sound effects and music. This project helped me a lot, mainly by teaching me how to think like a programmerâ€”a skill that has greatly benefited me in future coding projects.</p>
